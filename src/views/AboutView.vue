            <p>I can’t count how many times I waited for the Teams meeting to load, dreading the moment my itsekiri teachers voice greeted me “Ereosun Yeli. Bokor Uwo tegha.”</p>

            <p>Many times the lessons were fun, I relished being able to make my teacher laugh in another language, our language. And even she told me stories about herself, how her husband and her met, how…. It felt like the kind of story too sweet to reach me in English. </p>

            <p>Itsekiri was the language of all her days but for me it was the language of secrets of my mom telling me something she didn’t a t anyone else to hear, it was the language I strained to understand listening on the phone with my grandmother. It was slowly becoming the language of comfort of tenderness. There is nothing like my mother saying suduyemi or otormi to na to me. But It might never become my language of quickness, of ease. </p>

            <p>Sometimes when I would wait for my itsekiri teachers greeting I would grimace I would reschedule. When I was already having a particularly bad day or week the language lessons felt inconvenient and at worst reminders of my incompetence or of how much was outside my control. Of regret, of how there are somethings that happen too late. I won’t ever learn this I think. This is pointless. When she finishes a sentence sometimes I would feel like crying because I had no idea. None. Of what she was saying. IT was to me another language, as inaccessible and foreign as someone speaking in French. </p>

            <p>Sometimes those lessons would start and end in frustration but most times theft would be a turn, a word that rises up and catches my comprehension like a bird scooping a leaping fish. And I would understand that word. And using context I would understand the sentence I would understand what she was trying to tell me. The message would come through. </p>

            <p>Like gossip. Even without hearing it all, you can get a sense of what’s been told, the essence of the matter. </p>

            <p>On the days that still start with frustration I remind myself it’s about if the story makes its way to you. When you write or read anyway it’s not that the seytnged and the paragraphs snd the story makes its way to you exactly as the author thought it. The specific emotion coming through the words like a head out of water, when you finish a story you pick up bits and pieces of what’s being put down, and you come away with something. Urun bobo kpira ti wo give it time. </p>
            
            <p>I want to say lastly, modorkpe to my Itsekiri teacher for her patience with me.</p>
