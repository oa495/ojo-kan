                    <p>I can't count how many times I've waited in dread for the Teams meeting to load and my Itsẹkiri teacher's voice to greet me "Ere ọsọn Yeli. Bokọ uwo tegha?"</p>

                    <p>Many times the lessons turned out to be a lot of fun. I relished being able to make my teacher laugh in another language, our language. And when she told me stories about herself, it felt like the kind of story too sweet to reach me in English. </p>

                    <p>Itsẹkiri was and is the language of most of her days. But for me growing up, it was the language of secrets—my mom whispering to my dad in an elevator with foreigners—and the language I strained to understand talking on the phone with my grandmother. Now, it is slowly becoming the language of tenderness. There is nothing like my mother saying 'duduyemi' or 'otormi to sengwa otormi to na' when she sees me after a long while. And, it is also becoming the language of snark, of conspiration. I am, for the first time ever, <i>sometimes</i> in on the gossip.</p>

                    <p>I don't know if it'll ever become my language of quickness, of ease. </p>

                    <p>Somedays while I waited for my Itsẹkiri teacher's greeting I would grimace and reschedule. Especially on days or weeks that were already not going well, the language lessons felt at best inconvenient and at worst a reminder of my incompetence and how much was outside my control. It was a deliverer of regret, of how-I-wish-my-parents-had-taught-me-back-when-I-was-a-baby. Sometimes, when my teacher finishes a sentence in Itsẹkiri I felt like crying because I had no idea, <u>none</u> of what she was saying. </p>

                    <p>Sometimes those lessons would start and end in frustration but most times there would be a turn towards comprehension, a word that rises up and catches a synapse my comprehension like a bird scooping a leaping fish. I would understand that one word. And I would think of the context and then I would, <i>somehow somehow</i> understand the sentence and what she was trying to tell me. The message would come through. Kind of like gossip. Even without hearing it all, you can get a sense of the story being told, the essence of the matter. </p>

                    <p>This was the inspiration for Ọj'ọkan. As I learnt more of Itsẹkiri and went to cultural events filled with aunties and uncles gossiping in their language, I've been delighted to see that I can to pick up some words here and there, and consequently, have enough bits and pieces to piece together a tale. I wanted to create a website where a story slowly unveils itself to you, one inspired by 1) the careful attention needed to piece a narrative together based solely on overheard words and 2) the slow but rewarding process of learning a language. 
                    </p>

                    <p>On the days where my language lessons still start with frustration I remind myself that at the end of the day it is about whether the message makes its way to you. When you read a book you pick up bits and pieces of what's being put down, and you come away with something. I hope as the story unravels itself to you, you keep that in mind. </p>

                    <p>Itsẹkiri luckily and unluckily, while bearing some similarities to Yoruba, is not a popular Nigerian language with lots of learning resources. So you won't be able to drop it in Google Translate and get on with your day. To experience the full tale, you have to give it and yourself time. You have to put in a bit of work. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Finding this story was the same process. I looked up and down the internet to no avail until I found a video of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1380552859621461">an Itsẹkiri grandmother on Facebook telling the story of Ọlikpẹrẹbu.</a>Then my Itsẹkiri teacher painstakingly took me through the audio recording to transcribe and translate it. I am endlessly thankful to them both.</p>
