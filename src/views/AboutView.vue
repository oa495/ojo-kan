            <p>I can't count how many times I've waited in dread for the Teams meeting to load and my Itsẹkiri teacher's voice to greet me "Ere ọsọn Yeli. Bokọ Uwo tegha.”</p>

            <p>Many times the lessons turned out to be a lot of fun. I relished being able to make my teacher laugh in another language, our language. And when she told me stories about herself, about how she met husband, it felt like the kind of story too sweet to reach me in English. </p>

            <p>Itsẹkiri is and was the language of most of her days but for me growing up, it was the language of secrets -- my mom whispering to my dad in an elevator with foriegners -- and the language I strained to understand talking on the phone with my grandmother. It is now slowly becoming the language of tenderness. There is nothing like my mother saying 'duduyemi' or 'otormi to na' to me. And it's quickly becoming the language of snark, of conspiration. It might never become my language of quickness, of ease. </p>

            <p>Somedays while I waited for my Itsẹkiri teacher's greeting I would grimace and reschedule. Especially on days or weeks that were already not going well, the language lessons felt at best inconvenient and at worst a reminder of my incompetence and how much was outside my control. It was a deliverer of regret, of how-I-wish-my-parents-had-taught-me-back-when-I-had-a-baby-brain. Sometimes when my teacher finishes a sentence in Itsẹkiri I would feel like crying because I had no idea, none of what she was saying. </p>

            <p>Sometimes those lessons would start and end in frustration but most times there would be a turn for the better, a word that rises up and catches my comprehension like a bird scooping a leaping fish.  I would understand that word. And I would think of the context and then I would somehow understand the sentence and understand what she was trying to tell me. The message would come through. Kind of like gossip. Even without hearing it all, you can get a sense of the story being told, the essence of the matter. </p>

            <p>This was the inspiration for Ọj'ọkan. As I learnt more of the language and went to cultural events, filled with aunties and uncles gossiping in Itsekiri, I've been delighted to see that I can to pick up some words here and there, and consequently, have enough bits and pieces to piece together a tale. I wanted to create a website where a story slowly unveils itself to you, one inspired by the careful attention needed to piece a narrative together based solely on overheard words and the slow but rewarding process of learning a language. Itsẹkiri luckily and unluckily, while bearing some similarities to Yoruba, is not a popular language with lots of resources. So you won't be able to drop it in Google Translate and get on with your day.
            </p>

            <p>On the days where my language lessons still start with frustration I remind myself that at the end of the day it is about whether the message makes its way to you. When you read a book you pick up bits and pieces of what's being put down, and you come away with something. I hope as the story unravels itself to you, you keep that in mind. Urun bobo kpira ti wo give it time.

            <p>Lastly, mo dọkpẹ to my Itsẹkiri teacher. This project wouldn't have happened without you.  </p>
